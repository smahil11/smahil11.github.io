      <p>Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released on January 28th, 2022 with a big promise: to change the Pokémon formula. The games have been around since 1996 and together are the highest-grossing video game franchise today. Ever since that first contact with the amazing Pokémon Red/Blue, fans have mostly seen the same game concept in all mainline games: some young trainer taking on a villain team as she/he journeys to become the Pokémon league champion. The battling and catching mechanics have changed very little and newer games have made an effort to make training easier and faster (back in the day you could only exp. share with one Pokémon at a time!).

      So, when Legends: Arceus was announced the Pokémon world was full of expectations. A new game with an open-world concept, dynamic catching mechanics and actual battling going on (as opposed to the Pokémon Let’s Go games). However, the fans were not happy about the visuals of the game. A lot has been said about this game’s graphics and how it just doesn’t compare with modern open-world games.

      Now, over two months after release, we are going to explore Pokémon Legends: Arceus reviews from Metacritic and try to analyze a little of what users are saying about the game. The reviews were scraped using our scraper on March 19, 2022.</p>

      <p>As I continue to build this website out, I will include links to data sets and dashboards. Thank you for your patience!</p>
